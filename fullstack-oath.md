# Full stack developer's oath
Full stack development is _extremely hard_, that is why I will use all the possible means to make it easier
* I will have my browser developer console open all the time
* _I will use the network tab of the browser dev tools to ensure that frontend and backend are communicating as I expect_
* _I will constantly keep an eye on the state of the server to make sure that the data sent there by the frontend is saved there as I expect_
* I will progress with small steps
* I will write lots of `console.log` statements to make sure I understand how the code behaves and to help pinpoint problems
* If my code does not work, I will not write more code. Instead, I start deleting the code until it works or just return to a state when everything was still working
* When I ask for help in the course Discord or Telegram channel or elsewhere I formulate my questions properly, [see here how to ask for help](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part0/general_info#how-to-get-help-in-discord-telegram)
